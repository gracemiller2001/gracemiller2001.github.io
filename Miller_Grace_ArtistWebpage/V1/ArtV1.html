            <p> When you look at playlists/mixes of Jack Johnson’s music on <em> Spotify </em> or groupings of “up-next” on <em> YouTube,</em> you tend to get an eclectic variety, with <em> YouTube </em> providing artists like <em> Fleetwood Mac, </em> and Mario Nicola Simino. <em> Spotify's </em> curated playlists, such as “Jack Johnson Radio”, include artists like <em> Iron & Wine, </em> John Mayer, <em> Passanger, </em> etc. I strongly agree that these artists have a very similar sound to that of Johnson. </p>

        <h1>Biography </h1>
        <h2> About the Singer- </h2>
            <p> Jack Johnson is the head lead of his own musical group; however, he does have an accompanying band with members,
            Merlo, Adam, and Zach. His first album was released in 2001, and he has been making music ever since. In the
            mainstream, many people might recognize him as the voice behind the “Curious George” movie soundtrack in
            2006. His musical style could be considered a tropical style of soft pop, and according to <em> Spotify, </em> Johnson has
            8,577,003 monthly listeners! Johnson’s aesthetic definitely develops a sense of peace, with a Hawaiian feel, as
            Hawaii is where he is from. His music provides a sense of relaxation to everyday life through calming
            narrative-storytelling, enhanced with his guitar-playing and accompanying band, even though the lyrics can cover everything from
            having an affair outside of a committed relationship, to environmental/climate challenges, to time management/stress. Current
            activism and organizational impacts from Johnson include his participation in the previous <em> Global Citizen </em> “One World: Together at Home” concert during the pandemic, in addition to his work with different organizations in Hawaii, including his own organization, <em> All At Once.</em> </p>
