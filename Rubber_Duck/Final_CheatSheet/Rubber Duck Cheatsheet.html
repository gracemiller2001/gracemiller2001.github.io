    <h1> Welcome to our coding Bootstrap 5 Fillable Form Cheatsheet! </h1>
    <h2> By: Grace Miller and Oyinlola Kayode </h2>
        </div>

    <h3> Explanation of Fillable Form: </h3>

        <p> Fillable Form can be seen in many different ways depending on the directed user experience. For us, we noticed that 
            fillable form was present when you wanted to give your opinion on a forum, ask a question to an organization, etc. 
            Building the code requires new tags such as "textarea", "label", etc., which you will learn to use down below. </p>

 <!-- Step by step for coding + styling-->
    <h3> Step-by-Step Guide: </h3>
<!-- Step 1-->
    <h4> Step 1: Presteps </h4>
<!-- Step 1 Explanation-->
        <p> Start with your HTML. Create a new document, and begin with the shortcut we learned in class. "! + Enter Key". Once you have done that, you will want to link your bootstrap. First start with your comment as a note to yourself, then set up your code with
            href= "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-EVSTQN3/azprG1Anm3QDgpJLIm9Nao0Yz1ztcQTwFspd3yD65VohhpuuCOmLASjC" crossorigin="anonymous". Continue by opening title with your title in between the opening and closing tags, this title is what appears on your browser tab. Next, you should have your head tag closed, and body tag open. Below, you will have your first div with class= "container" to follow nesting procedures, followed by any other additional classes and >. List your heading tags using h1 and h2 as you deem fit, and close the div.
        </p>

<!-- Step 2-->
<h4> Step 2: Creating a Label  </h4>
<!-- Step 2 Explanation-->
        <p> Put in a new comment for your first set of code, this could be for a label, etc. You will need to open your form tag, and give it a div class= "row"> for nesting. If you are creating a label, you will need to set up your code with the tag "label for= "---with what the label is for---", followed by the ---text--- that will be shown to the user before closing the label tag. Next, you will open an input tag, describing the type of input that will be placed there, such as the text content, you can also select other content types such as email, numbers etc. You will then define a class and id before closing the input ">" and closing your div.
        </p>

<!-- Step 3-->
<h4> Step 3: Creating a Selection </h4>
<!-- Step 3 Explanation-->
        <p> Put a new comment for your code here that describes the type of selection you want your user to make. Open another div class= "row" for nesting, and add another label tag, this time pertaining to your selection. Open your select tag, and give it a class and id. Next, you will create your option tags, which demonstrate what options can be selected. Each option tag will be composed of a value (what the option is), and the text that the user can see, that describes the option before the option tag is closed. After you are done coding the possible options, close your select tag, and div tag.</p>

<!-- Step 4-->
<h4> Step 4: Creating a Text Area </h4>
<!-- Step 4 Explanation-->
        <p> Put a new comment for your code that relates to the textbox using the textarea tag. Once again, you are going to open another div class= "row", as all these elements are lining up in rows, under one column. Next, give yourself a label like in the other steps. Finally, open the textarea tag, and fill it with a class, id, number of rows, and a placeholder if you'd like, before closing the textarea tag. Close your div.</p>
<!-- Step 4 Image-->

<!-- Step 5-->
<h4> Step 5: Creating a Button </h4>
<!-- Step 5 Explanation-->
        <p> Write a new comment, this one relating to your button, adding what we have been practicing throughout, div class= "row". Below, open your button tag, and it's specific type, class, and text that the user will see, before closing the button tag. Make sure you have ended your div and form tags here as well. Also make sure that the body and html closing tags follow to end the html.</p>

<!-- Note on CSS-->
<h4> Note: Coding the CSS </h4>
<!-- CSS Explanation-->
        <p> Coding the CSS means styling. Using the classes you have given each independent set of code, list those classes in the CSS format, as ".class with the { } universal selector filled with styles of your choosing such as font-family:---; color:----; etc.</p>
