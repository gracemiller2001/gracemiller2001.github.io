                <p> Use your meal as the starting point to your home vacation. Select your destination, and see what places in your area serve food from that location! For a
                    Latin America inspired dish, I chose to get a delicious cheese quesadilla meal from my favorite local spot in Pittsboro, N.C., <em> Mi Cancun!</em> </p>

                <p> Music is essentail to your experience, and you can start listening to it in the car on the way to pick up your meal! Support your local radio when possible for your 
                    music choice, and in the case of Latin America, I have chosen to listen to my favorite, Central North Carolina's Spanish radio station, <em> La Ley!</em> on 101.1 FM. </p>

                <p> The day or night would not be the same without something to read or watch. My go-to for any traveler includes reading any of <em> Lonely Planet's</em> travel books on your 
                preferred destination, or visiting the <em> Expedia YouTube</em> page, where they have virtual tours/itneraries of different global cities, with my favorite being on Mexico City! 
                Watch one that interests you, while you eat your meal! </p>

    </div>
    <div class= "row5">
                <p> To make the setting a reality, make sure to pick up some decorations for the space you will be enjoying your vacation at. If it is your kitchen, try dinnerware, if it is your room, 
                try trinkers. The decoration can be homemade (which you can use as your activity) or you can shop locally, or online, perhaps at <em> Etsy! </em> I love the trinkets I have in my room 
                from Mexico, one of which is from <em>Disney</em> but, I also love to shop at my favorite store, <em> Tienda Hispana El Rayo.</em></p>

    <div class= "row5">
                <p> Immerse yourself to the best of your ability in the culture of the region of your desired vacation. Want to cook something for desert, or maybe
                    for breakfast the next morning? Buy, or rent (at your local library), a cookbook, or find a recipe online. I love the "pan dulce" from my local bakery, <em> Carolina Cravings</em>, 
                    and I hope that one day, I can learn how to make it myself. Until then, I will continye making "Besitos de Coco" from my favorite cookbook authors, Patricia Cartin. </p>

    <div class= "row5">
                <p> While not all seasons allow for good outside weather, inside can be just as relaxing. A late-summer night on the patio, surrounded by blooms, is always my go-to, but if you 
                    are staying inside, try playing with different lighting and scents. The candle company, <em> Homesick Candles, </em> has you covered with candles that smell like countries/cities around the world! In this instance, 
                    I would opt for their, <em> Mexico </em> candle. </p>

                <p> This stay-at-home vacation experience is sure to prep you with the knowledge and inspiration you'll need for your next out-of-the-house escape! After being able to explore the culture, and perhaps even the language of
                    your destination from home, the world awaits you to turn your first glance into a wider global-view! </p>
